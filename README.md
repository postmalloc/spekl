# spekl - A Rust Point-Cloud Processing Library

Spekl is a point-cloud processing library written in Rust. My motivation for
writing this library is to get better at Rust and to have a performant, easy to
use point-cloud processing library that can be used in other projects. I wish to
attain feature parity with PCL someday but that is a long way off.
